I usually double this batch. Everyone likes to have at least one last tortilla drizzled with honey as a dessert. And if you have leftovers, keep them in a Ziploc in the fridge, in order to make scrambled eggs burritos tomorrow for breakfast or quesadillas for lunch. Just warm your tortillas oh-so-briefly in the microwave to soften them up. Alternately, you can use a leftover tortilla to make a tortilla pizza. A little pizza sauce and some parmesan on top. Then warm it on a griddle, in the microwave, or briefly in the toaster oven. With so many possibilities for leftover tortillas, maybe you should make a triple batch to begin with.",

Then there was that cool autumn evening when I wanted soup but had no bread in the house. Usually we opt for biscuits, but I really wanted something soft and yeasty. Guess what! Dinner rolls don’t have a long rising stage. They go from “wish I had that” to “warm and yummy” amazingly quickly. So don’t wait until you’re 50-something to give this recipe a try. \n\n2021: When COVID-19 forced us all to venture to grocery stores as seldom as possible, I realized that this dinner roll recipe makes great hamburg and hotdog buns. No need to run quick to the grocer to pick up fresh buns; make them from scratch. The result is a soft, slightly sweet and very pleasant white-carb-bun for your grilled meat or un-meat, barbecue,pulled pork, brats, or other sandwich creations. These are more substantial and flavorful than the mushy, flavorless store-bought bun varieties which are nothing more than a way to keep your topping together without getting too much ketchup on your fingers.Using this recipe, divide your dough into 12 portions. You can shape these portions into hamburg or hotdog bun shapes (or some of each) and arrange them in a greased 9x13 pan. When your bun shapes have risen and before you put them in the oven to bake, press them down a little so that the buns are wider and shorter (and easier to load up and still fit into your mouth). Enjoy! ",

Even if it’s not pizza night, these bread sticks are a great, comforting addition to many meals, soups, and pasta nights. Thanks, Dad!\n2021: Dad’s soft breadsticks are so yummy that they have become their own menu item. No longer just a part of pizza night, these get requested for some of our soup evenings, for Bible study potlucks, and for watching films or the Green Bay Packers. These are not the dry crackers shaped like sticks; they are soft and delicious usually sprinkled with herbs and parmesan. Because these breadsticks are soft, consider putting out dipper bowls and options like balsamic vinegar or olive oils with extra herbs and parmesan to sprinkle in. The soft texture is perfect for soaking up oil and vinegars. Alternately serve with thick pizza sauce, a cheese sauce, or toum, a Mediterranean garlic dip",

You can even eliminate the sour cream and increase the amount of beef broth to 2 ½ cups, to please the person who doesn’t like the sour cream tang. Then you end up with meat and gravy, but that’s still comfort food. Someday though, I’m going to make this recipe with a whole pound of mushrooms and 3 onions. Just for me.\n2021: Tofu Stroganoff.  Adapt this recipe to create a vegetarian stroganoff by sauteing chunks of extra-firm tofu instead of beef and adding dried basil, 1 Tablespoon of soy sauce, and extra pepper to the seasonings. If you’re cooking for spice lovers, feel free to add a small amount of red pepper flakes and extra garlic. (I’m not adding those things, but you could.) Remove your sauteed tofu to a bowl while you make the gravy using a flavorful mushroom- or veggie-based stock instead of the beef stock. When you have added the milk and your sauce is almost warm enough, gently stir in your sauteed tofu and warm everything to your favorite eating temperature. Serve with either cooked pasta or good rice, and set out the soy sauce bottle to add extra flavoring at the end.",

This is a simple, rice-y casserole with soy sauce as its main flavoring. A warm bowl of this rice dish, whether fresh or as leftovers, definitely qualifies as “comfort food”. One day when we were out of celery, Dad substituted carrots, and ever since then carrots are part of our chop suey recipe. This is a crowd-pleasing potluck dish and a winner with most kids. Just don’t order “chop suey” in a Chinese restaurant and expect anything like this.\n2021:  Google says that “chop suey” is a mixture of cooked vegetables, sometimes also with meat, along with sauces that is served over already cooked rice or noodles. (This definition only being somewhat helpful since this describes a good two-thirds of the items on any Chinese restaurant menu.) In contrast, “chow mein” is a chop suey-like mixture but with cooked noodles stirred into the dish. Anyway, although this recipe arguably does involve some “chop”, it obviously has nothing to do with “suey” nor “mein”. So, let’s agree to call this “Hamburger-Rice Casserole.” \nEven though I know that neither Andrew nor Jason are great fans of this particular comfort food recipe, I’m going to guess that any future little versions of themselves or other youngsters in their lives would probably like this dish. This truly is a popular recipe among most children (confirmed by completely unscientific Pruim-family research over two decades). So, if you’re looking for a kid-friendly homemade potluck dish and you can’t just order pizza because of lactose or gluten issues among your guests, remember THIS recipe. "

When budgets were tight and eating out with kids wasn’t relaxing, I had to figure out how to make hot and sour soup for myself. I keep the leftovers in 1-pint glass jars and bring it to work for lunch. Yummm!\n2021: Souper COVID-times. Dropping off glass jars of soup curb-side and contact-free is one way to stay connected to people. If you are connecting socially distant outside in cool weather, you can also serve up large mugs of a soup like this one to keep everyone warm and happy while you chat. \nReasons I love this soup: \n\tIt is cheap and I can make it anytime with ingredients I always have in the house. Let it be known, however, that I am against Penny pinching. ;)\n\tOther non-Asian folks can be so easily impressed that a tasty hot-and-sour soup can be had somewhere other than their local Chinese restaurant. \n\tThough I am not guaranteeing this, I believe this is a pretty low-calorie soup, and even though it is considered a broth-based and “thin” soup, I find it very satisfying. \n\tWhen folks have a cold or are feeling a wee bit queasy because of chemotherapy, this soup goes down easily, warms you up, and makes you feel loved. Quintessential comfort food. … but with a fun Asian twist."

In fact, he usually makes these sometime around Christmas – a big enough batch to bring some to his students and still have some to keep the homebodies happy. These are the opposite of the chewy, sweet cookies that tend to be the family favorites. And yet there’s something about them showing up every December. Even niece Paige said one December after she had moved away, that she missed these cookies.\n2021: When Jason traveled back to Germany as an adult in January 2020 (Yes, squeezing that trip in just before the COVID crises effectively shut down international travel for the common person), he made a point to visit Wiblingen where we lived for 6 months when he was 5 years old. He visited the monastery complex where our apartment building stood (where Napoleon stabled his horses), the tiny neighborhood grocer, the local bakery, his nursery school, and the park with the very free-ranging chickens. And he brought back a cookie cutter in the shape of the famous nearby Ulmer cathedral. Although Cinnamon Stars are by definition “stars,” you can, of course, use any cookie cutters that make you happy. My very special Ulm cathedral cookie cutter is mostly a Christmas tree ornament, but I’m thinking that “Cinnamon Cathedrals” has a nice ring to it. Besides if the cookies are bigger, you get to eat more cookie with each serving. Not that anyone ever felt deterred from grabbing two or three stars at a time. In fact, now that I’m thinking about it: I think everyone always takes at least two stars at a time. Inquiring minds want to know: if the Cinnamon stars were Cinnamon cathedrals, would folks serve themselves only one cookie?",

You will make someone’s day with this special baked treat.\n2021: Spending decades in West Michigan, I never realized how challenging it can be to procure almond paste. If it shows up near you around Christmas, buy extra to stock up for baking this almond coffee cake and Mrs. Miller’s Almond bars (Recipe 26).

We all miss her banket which really was better than the store-bought varieties. Boterkoek has some of those same flavors. In fact, folks think this recipe has almond paste in it, even though the lovely flavor is just from almond extract. That makes the recipe a frugal option – even Dutch-ier.\n2021: The GREAT thing about this recipe is that it calls for almond extract which is cheaper and easier to find than almond paste. Also, while you should check this out for yourself to be sure, I hear that McCormick brand almond extract is actually nut-free. So, when Hannah who actually loves nuts but is mildly allergic married into the family, I surprised her with this delicious almondy snack that she could enjoy.\nThis recipe baked in a 9x13 pan is perfect if you have to provide individually wrapped goods for a bake sale. One of my colleagues had a daughter who made her middle school pocket money by having her dad put out a box of these Boterkoek treats for sale every week at work. ",

It’s worth it because homemade pie crust is worth the investment.\nTip C: This recipe is for two crusts. If you’re bothering to make the bowl, pastry cutter, and mat dirty, you should really just make two crusts (or possibly even four!). If you’re not immediately using more than one crust, then freeze the remaining crust(s), each shaped and placed into a pie plate inside a 2-gallon Ziploc. Having a ready-to-go homemade pie crust in your freezer, makes it a breeze to whip up a quiche and pretty easy to get an apple crumb pie baked in time to serve your in-laws who suggested they could just stop by later this evening",

              "description": "Nik spent a year tweaking chocolate chip cookie recipes to get to this final awesome recipe winner. Yes, the brothers suffered through a year of cookie testing. Poor things. This recipe is purposely twice the size of most cookie recipes because otherwise there are not enough cookies to keep the natives from getting restless … or greedy. Seriously.\nAfter years of being the cookie sous chef for Anika, Jason determined that he can indeed make these cookies all by himself. Plus, with his big brother living across town, Jason can easily control how many cookies to allot to his cookie-monster sibling. And another delightful Jason discovery is that you can store made cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least a week, making it easy to have fresh, warm, gooey cookies right now and then again in a few days. This is true unless someone in the house has a secret addiction to raw cookie dough. (This has not been proven to be the case, but occasionally we have our suspicions.)",

How can this happen to a Green Bay Packers fan and an avowed cheese-a-holic?! The good news is that cheesy or creamy goodness is still possible using many of the recipes and recipe options in the Comfort Food cookbook. In many cases, all you have to do is use lactose-free milk options for the milk ingredient and, when appropriate, reach for a modest amount of aged cheese or parmesan.",
