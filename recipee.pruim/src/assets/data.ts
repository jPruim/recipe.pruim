It’s hard to compare tortillas baked who knows when in a factory and packaged in plastic for more than a couple days with fresh, soft, homemade tortillas, warm from the griddle.\n\n2021: Please make extra tortillas. I usually double this batch. Everyone likes to have at least one last tortilla drizzled with honey as a dessert. And if you have leftovers, keep them in a Ziploc in the fridge, in order to make scrambled eggs burritos tomorrow for breakfast or quesadillas for lunch. Just warm your tortillas oh-so-briefly in the microwave to soften them up. Alternately, you can use a leftover tortilla to make a tortilla pizza. A little pizza sauce and some parmesan on top. Then warm it on a griddle, in the microwave, or briefly in the toaster oven. With so many possibilities for leftover tortillas, maybe you should make a triple batch to begin with.",

        "description": "For decades I avoided making dinner rolls. I just put out homemade bread and, of course, no one complained. Then there was that cool autumn evening when I wanted soup but had no bread in the house. Usually we opt for biscuits, but I really wanted something soft and yeasty. Guess what! Dinner rolls don’t have a long rising stage. They go from “wish I had that” to “warm and yummy” amazingly quickly. So don’t wait until you’re 50-something to give this recipe a try. \n\n2021: When COVID-19 forced us all to venture to grocery stores as seldom as possible, I realized that this dinner roll recipe makes great hamburg and hotdog buns. No need to run quick to the grocer to pick up fresh buns; make them from scratch. The result is a soft, slightly sweet and very pleasant white-carb-bun for your grilled meat or un-meat, barbecue,pulled pork, brats, or other sandwich creations. These are more substantial and flavorful than the mushy, flavorless store-bought bun varieties which are nothing more than a way to keep your topping together without getting too much ketchup on your fingers.Using this recipe, divide your dough into 12 portions. You can shape these portions into hamburg or hotdog bun shapes (or some of each) and arrange them in a greased 9x13 pan. When your bun shapes have risen and before you put them in the oven to bake, press them down a little so that the buns are wider and shorter (and easier to load up and still fit into your mouth). Enjoy! ",

Thanks, Dad!\n2021: Dad’s soft breadsticks are so yummy that they have become their own menu item. No longer just a part of pizza night, these get requested for some of our soup evenings, for Bible study potlucks, and for watching films or the Green Bay Packers. These are not the dry crackers shaped like sticks; they are soft and delicious usually sprinkled with herbs and parmesan. Because these breadsticks are soft, consider putting out dipper bowls and options like balsamic vinegar or olive oils with extra herbs and parmesan to sprinkle in. The soft texture is perfect for soaking up oil and vinegars. Alternately serve with thick pizza sauce, a cheese sauce, or toum, a Mediterranean garlic dip",

        "description": "I have no idea why this is called chop suey. That’s how the original recipe came down to us from Grandma Pruim. This is a simple, rice-y casserole with soy sauce as its main flavoring. A warm bowl of this rice dish, whether fresh or as leftovers, definitely qualifies as “comfort food”. One day when we were out of celery, Dad substituted carrots, and ever since then carrots are part of our chop suey recipe. This is a crowd-pleasing potluck dish and a winner with most kids. Just don’t order “chop suey” in a Chinese restaurant and expect anything like this.\n2021: Google says that “chop suey” is a mixture of cooked vegetables, sometimes also with meat, along with sauces that is served over already cooked rice or noodles. (This definition only being somewhat helpful since this describes a good two-thirds of the items on any Chinese restaurant menu.) In contrast, “chow mein” is a chop suey-like mixture but with cooked noodles stirred into the dish. Anyway, although this recipe arguably does involve some “chop”, it obviously has nothing to do with “suey” nor “mein”. So, let’s agree to call this “Hamburger-Rice Casserole.” \nEven though I know that neither Andrew nor Jason are great fans of this particular comfort food recipe, I’m going to guess that any future little versions of themselves or other youngsters in their lives would probably like this dish. This truly is a popular recipe among most children (confirmed by completely unscientific Pruim-family research over two decades). So, if you’re looking for a kid-friendly homemade potluck dish and you can’t just order pizza because of lactose or gluten issues among your guests, remember THIS recipe. "

The soup always has potatoes…except when it doesn’t.\n2021: A favorite Autumn variety is Butternut Squash Soup: Potatoes + Onions + Butternut Squash. With its golden color, you can actually hide an obscene amount of cheddar cheese in this soup OR convince a certain someone that there is already more cheese in the soup than there actually is. \nJason’s favorite is Broccoli Cheese Soup: Use 5-6 cups of chopped broccoli, one chopped onion, and a chopped potato (although the potato is optional). At the end, after adding the milk and heating through, stir in a generous portion of shredded cheddar cheese. Serve with more cheese. Did I mention cheese?\nCheater clam chowder: Use potatoes and onions or leeks for the vegetables. Stir in canned clams with their juice at the end when you add the milk and heat through. \nPotatoes. I recommend Idaho/russets, golden, or white potatoes for making soups like this one.\nTurnips: These are round, sort of ball-shaped, and are really an okay, if slightly expensive, addition. However, I cannot recommend Parsnips (which look like white carrots). I’ve had more than one batch of expensive and bitter farmers’ market parsnips. With so many other friendly root vegetables, why bother. Remember: “Turnips should Turn Up sometimes. But be Persnickety about Parsnips.”",

Dropping off glass jars of soup curb-side and contact-free is one way to stay connected to people. If you are connecting socially distant outside in cool weather, you can also serve up large mugs of a soup like this one to keep everyone warm and happy while you chat. \nReasons I love this soup: \n\tIt is cheap and I can make it anytime with ingredients I always have in the house. Let it be known, however, that I am against Penny pinching. ;)\n\tOther non-Asian folks can be so easily impressed that a tasty hot-and-sour soup can be had somewhere other than their local Chinese restaurant. \n\tThough I am not guaranteeing this, I believe this is a pretty low-calorie soup, and even though it is considered a broth-based and “thin” soup, I find it very satisfying. \n\tWhen folks have a cold or are feeling a wee bit queasy because of chemotherapy, this soup goes down easily, warms you up, and makes you feel loved.

In fact, he usually makes these sometime around Christmas – a big enough batch to bring some to his students and still have some to keep the homebodies happy. These are the opposite of the chewy, sweet cookies that tend to be the family favorites. And yet there’s something about them showing up every December. Even niece Paige said one December after she had moved away, that she missed these cookies.\n2021: When Jason traveled back to Germany as an adult in January 2020 (Yes, squeezing that trip in just before the COVID crises effectively shut down international travel for the common person), he made a point to visit Wiblingen where we lived for 6 months when he was 5 years old. He visited the monastery complex where our apartment building stood (where Napoleon stabled his horses), the tiny neighborhood grocer, the local bakery, his nursery school, and the park with the very free-ranging chickens. And he brought back a cookie cutter in the shape of the famous nearby Ulmer cathedral. Although Cinnamon Stars are by definition “stars,” you can, of course, use any cookie cutters that make you happy. My very special Ulm cathedral cookie cutter is mostly a Christmas tree ornament, but I’m thinking that “Cinnamon Cathedrals” has a nice ring to it. Besides if the cookies are bigger, you get to eat more cookie with each serving. Not that anyone ever felt deterred from grabbing two or three stars at a time. In fact, now that I’m thinking about it: I think everyone always takes at least two stars at a time. Inquiring minds want to know: if the Cinnamon stars were Cinnamon cathedrals, would folks serve themselves only one cookie?",

We all miss her banket which really was better than the store-bought varieties. Boterkoek has some of those same flavors. In fact, folks think this recipe has almond paste in it, even though the lovely flavor is just from almond extract. That makes the recipe a frugal option – even Dutch-ier.\n2021: The GREAT thing about this recipe is that it calls for almond extract which is cheaper and easier to find than almond paste. Also, while you should check this out for yourself to be sure, I hear that McCormick brand almond extract is actually nut-free. So, when Hannah who actually loves nuts but is mildly allergic married into the family, I surprised her with this delicious almondy snack that she could enjoy.\nThis recipe baked in a 9x13 pan is perfect if you have to provide individually wrapped goods for a bake sale. One of my colleagues had a daughter who made her middle school pocket money by having her dad put out a box of these Boterkoek treats for sale every week at work. ",

It’s worth it because homemade pie crust is worth the investment.\nTip C: This recipe is for two crusts. If you’re bothering to make the bowl, pastry cutter, and mat dirty, you should really just make two crusts (or possibly even four!). If you’re not immediately using more than one crust, then freeze the remaining crust(s), each shaped and placed into a pie plate inside a 2-gallon Ziploc.

This recipe is purposely twice the size of most cookie recipes because otherwise there are not enough cookies to keep the natives from getting restless … or greedy. Seriously.\nAfter years of being the cookie sous chef for Anika, Jason determined that he can indeed make these cookies all by himself. Plus, with his big brother living across town, Jason can easily control how many cookies to allot to his cookie-monster sibling. And another delightful Jason discovery is that you can store made cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least a week, making it easy to have fresh, warm, gooey cookies right now and then again in a few days. This is true unless someone in the house has a secret addiction to raw cookie dough. (This has not been proven to be the case, but occasionally we have our suspicions.)",

First, slice into your fat so you have a bunch of pieces. Go ahead and rock your cutter blades through your fat. Flick any  stuck on ones back off your cutter. Repeat after me: Slice and rock, rock and roll, lift and land your cutter around your bowl.This  action 'cuts' the butter 'into' the dry ingredients. Before ONE of your favorite songs has finished playing, you are ready to move on  to adding your milk. See? That wasn't sooo hard. (P.S. If you have no cutter, use two butter knives - one in each hand and keep  cutting across your fat + flour until those crumbles magically appear. It will take about 4 minutes.)",

They turned out to be so expensive, I needed another  everyday option – one that could also substitute for breakfast on the run, because no matter how important I say breakfast is, some  certain persons still do not always manage to leave enough time for a good sit down breakfast, especially on Tuesdays",

Break up your bars by hand  or in a food processor and call it granola. If your family notices  that it’s nothing like the Groovy Granola you usually make,  just say you’re experimenting. If they’re still not sure, add  some nuts and dried fruit and sell it as “snack mix”.

It took a while to lure them back to  granola, but they have all agreed that it is, in fact, delicious and so much better (and less expensive!) than anything that comes in a  cardboard box or a fancy container with the word 'organic' on it. About that family vacation touring various desserts in the hottest  part of summer ... the final verdicts are still out.

          \n\n1. Smear a medium size plate with a circle of yogurt (vanilla, strawberry, chocolate -- your choice). \
          \n\n2. Put out whatever fruit your kids like: bananas, grapes, raisins, pineapple, melon slices, mandarin oranges, dried apricots, mango,  sliced kiwi, berries of any sort, apple chopped/sliced/in rings, ... you get the idea: whichever fruits float your boat ... or happen to  be on sale this week. This step #2 is why there is any prep time at all: you have to set out the fruit in a way that will encourage play. \
          \n\n3. Make available Hair/Beard options: granola, chopped nuts, sunflower seeds, flaked coconut. Certain boxed cereals make very  reasonable hair, like little O's or your favorite flakes. \
          \n\nIf you are an idealist, you probably already felt betrayed by the suggestion of boxed cereal. If this is true, skip to Step 5. \
          \n\n4. Because you are at heart a benevolent monarch of the kitchen realm, you might allow honey, chocolate chips, maple syrup or something as decadent as jam (because, honestly, what do they put in the bottom of those 'fruit on the bottom' yogurt cups anyway  and no one thinks you're a bad parent for giving your kid one of those). \
          \n\n5. LET THE GAMES BEGIN! Each child creates his or her own best fruit face. Take pictures before eating. Post to the internet to  impress your friends. No, wait ... we only do that when we've served flaming bananas.",

          \nThese really are best warm from the oven, but since the stars so seldom align in a way that allows everyone to be seated at the table at  the precise moment the rolls are done, reheating just a wee bit in the microwave is good. \
          \n\nCreative Cooking \
          \nThis basic recipe can be made into cinnamon swirl bread or cinnamon raisin bread. When you are smearing the sugar and butter on  your rectangle of dough, stay away from the short ends. Roll up your scroll, seal the edge. Place this long scroll with the seam side  down on a greased cookie sheet or a 9x13 cake pan. Then shape the short ends by pulling the dough down and around and tuck it sort  of under the ends to hide the sugar glaze. Let it rise for an hour. Then bake at 375 F. for 40-50 minutes until light brown on top. When bread is still hot from the oven, it does not slice well. So, if you're making this loaf version of cinnamon rolls instead of rolls,  you're planning on eating your bread when cooler. Of course, you still want the Amaze-a-Glaze (or the kids will revolt).  \
          \n\nCheating ... um, I mean ... Planning ahead\nThese rolls are so popular, I usually make a double batch. I bake one batch in a 9x13 pan for immediate consumption. I divide the  other batch into two 9-inch round cake pans and bake them. When the round half-batches are completely cooled, I put each on a  paper plate, then into a zippered plastic bag and into the freezer. If I take these out the night before, I can warm them slightly in the  oven or microwave and add the Amaze-a-Glaze in the morning. I won't tell you it's just as good as fresh-baked, but I assure you that  no one complains.",

That is why this dive into continental cuisine  counts as “the ultimate cheater breakfast.” The trick to turning this basic fare into one of my family’s favorite meals is GOOD bread  and YUMMY toppings.",

Go international with  really good naan, German health bread (the dark brown compact bricks filled with seeds and all sorts of stuff the Germans call  “Ballaststoff” and we call fiber), a great sour-dough, croissants, or whatever else your family craves. But do NOT serve only  Wonderbread. If you do, one of my children (who have spent just enough time in Germany to become bread snobs) may magically  appear and poof your poor choice of bread into oblivion by smushing the entire loaf into the size of a golf ball. IF you serve only  Wonderbread, the possible failure of your family to appreciate “German breakfast” will not be on my conscience.\
        \n\nTOPPINGS.\n If you invest in staple toppings for your pantry, you can pull them out of the cupboards whenever you are in need of a  super quick breakfast. We suggest: different varieties of peanut or nut or sunflower seed butters, unsalted butter, Dutch chocolate sprinkles, a variety of fruit spreads, tapenades, marinated  veggies, honey, and of course chocolate hazelnut spread.  Other toppings which must generally be eaten with a week  include: good cheeses, deli meats, spinach dip, egg salad, cream cheeses, Festive Feta*, and Must-hum Hummus**.  \n\nMust-hum Hummus** Before Hummus could be bought in 12 flavors in every grocer, we made  hummus ourselves, didn’t we? Blend together in a food processor: cream cheeses.\n\nFestive Feta* Crumble some feta into a microwavable bowl. Bonus points  if it’s a pretty bowl. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle  with dried basil and oregano. Optional: stir in a modest  amount of chopped red or green onion. Microwave 45-90  seconds or until melty. (No matter what the computer says,  1 can drained chick peas 1 tablespoon tahini paste 1 teaspoon garlic chopped 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon lemon juice Optional stir ins ½ teaspoon basil, dill, or oregano Hot sauce, to taste Ground black pepper ½ tsp Tahi red pepper garlic past ¼ spoons of chick pea liquid “melty” is a word.)

Cooking the rice separately and adding the rice to each bowl as you ladle the soup OR adding some leftover cooked rice in the last few minutes keeps the soup from becoming a porridge. *Also, although our family finds new crop long grain jasmine rice to be superior for all rice-y things, in this soup using basmati rice can also keep your grains intact and more separate (not clumping together). So, it may be worth it to have a small supply of basmati rice next to the 20 lb. bag of jasmine from the import store. ;) https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/231291/hearty-chicken-and-rice-soup/"

          occupation of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) wanted soup at the start of their meals. While this may have\
          been a British tradition, it was not a common practice in that part of the world. The creative Tamil\
          servants watered down a peppery stew and served that. The British wanted to add meat and other\
          ingredients more familiar to them. Long story short: lots of different variations got created by\
          creative cooks in that part of the world and then back in Britain. In a myriad of east-meets-west\
          combinations, mulligatawny, according to the internet, has become a common British pub menu\
          staple. A fairly simple stew, mulligatawny very often includes chicken, rice, and apple along with\
          bespoke combinations of spices that we might recognize as variations of Indian curries. You could\
          call this “curry soup” but “mulligatawny” is so much more fun. BTW In Germany this soup is\
          named in the English-language sketch “Dinner for One” which many Germans watch ritually every\
          year around New Year’s."

I used to hate the kidney beans, so I would pick them all out and eat them first, then enjoy the meat and sauce. After a couple years of doing that, I decided the beans were part of the chili and I learned to enjoy the chili in an integrated way. \n\nI have to admit to outsiders that our family has grown into spice-wimps. We like a wide variety of spices and flavors, but when it comes to spicey-“heat” – we are minimalists. We like to blame this on the children when they were young, or on the 6 years that we lived with Grandma Dykstra. But nowadays we have no real excuse. It just is. So, it’s a bit unfair to call this “Rockin” chili. I suspect most folks will want to up the amount of zip and heat that we have in these chili recipes. Fortunately, that’s easy to do. And if you are my sister and brother-in-law, just throw in some jalapenos and set out the hot sauces."

          Once long ago I tagged along with Randy to a conference in New Orleans. I got to explore the \
          French Quarter, listen to jazz, visit a yarn shop, and take a Cajun cooking class. Why didn’t I do \
          more of this in life? Anyway, I adapted the yummy gumbo recipe from that cooking class to suit \
          my family, and they all loved it. Jason wonders why I didn’t make this more often. Answer: mostly \
          because it takes time and patience to make the caramel-colored roux and I so seldom had that 15 \
          minutes to just stand at the stove stirring single-mindedly; there were always several other things \
          that I tried to do whilst making dinner. But if you do have the time, this really is delicious and \

Otherwise, you run the risk of certain somebodies slowly helping themselves to more and more little nibbles from the meat platter and before you know it, you haven’t got enough beef for your soup plans. If this happens, then you can just make Vegetable Soup including a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.\

          curious and rare occurrence. One could even call “leftover gravy” an oxymoron. But if this is \
          something you’ve got in the fridge, go for it. Or you can even make extra gravy with your original \
          beef dinner, but you might have to put some aside – never even bringing the surplus gravy to the \
          table and denying the existence of additional gravy in the kitchen. See Tip #1.",
